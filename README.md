# Phonytext
PhonyText, implemented using Python, which is based on Binary classification of news,  aims to detect whether the news is fake or not. The Natural language Toolkit (NLTK) is deployed for preprocessing. Further, supervised learning like Naive Bayes and Decision Tree were used and it was found that the latter performed better.
